# Lab 2 Assignment: Practicing git / GitHub and a review of R basics from Lab 1
#
# Instructions:
# - Complete each exercise by replacing "# YOUR CODE HERE" with your code
# - Save and commit after completing each section
# - Push your commits to GitHub when done
# Remember: Make at least 3 commits as you work through this file!
#=========================================================

#=========================================================
# Section 1: Git Concepts (XX points)
# Write your code underneath the comment for each question.
# Keep your answers to 1-2 sentences.
#=========================================================

# Question 1: What does "commit" mean in Git?
# Store your answer in a variable named "Q1_answer"


# Question 2: What is the difference between "commit" and "push"?
# Store your answer in a variable named "Q2_answer"


# Question 3: Why is version control useful for scientific research?
# Store your answer in a variable named "Q3_answer"

# Question 4: Variable Assignment (XX points)
# 4a. Create a numeric variable called 'my_age' containing your age


# 4b. Create a character variable called 'my_name' containing your name


# 4c. Create a numeric variable called 'pi_approx' equal to 3.14159


# 4d. Create a logical variable called 'is_student' set to TRUE


# Question 5: Vectors (XX points)
# 5a. Create a numeric vector called 'temperatures' with these values:
#     6, 8, -2, 1, -5
# These values represent daily temperatures for a week


# 5b. Create a character vector called 'days' with these values:
#     "Mon", "Tue", "Wed", "Thu", "Fri"


# 5c. Access the third element of 'temperatures' and store it in 'wed_temp'


# 5d. Calculate the number of elements in 'temperatures' using length()
# store the result in a numeric variable called 'num_days'


# Question 6: Basic Math Operations (XX points)
# Use these given values for your calculations:
a <- 10
b <- 3

# 6a. Calculate a + b and store in 'sum_ab'


# 6b. Calculate a - b and store in 'diff_ab'


# 6c. Calculate a * b and store in 'prod_ab'


# 6d. Calculate a / b and store in 'div_ab'


# 6e. Calculate a raised to the power of b (a^b) and store in 'power_ab'


# 6f. Calculate the remainder when a is divided by b
# store the result in numeric variable called 'remainder_ab'


# 6g. Calculate the mean (average) of the 'temperatures' vector
#     Do this by dividing the sum by the length
#     Store the result in 'mean_temp'
